[`project`][type-project] | [Finding Lane Lines on the Road](https://github.com/romanroibu/carnd-find-lane-lines) | In this project, you will be writing code to identify lane lines on the road, first in an image, and later in a video stream (really just a series of images). To complete this project you will use the tools you learned about in the lesson, and build upon them. |
[`project`][type-project] | [Advanced Lane Finding](https://github.com/romanroibu/carnd-advanced-lane-finding) | In this project, your goal is to write a software pipeline to identify the lane boundaries in a video from a front-facing camera on a car. |
[`project`][type-project] | Vehicle Tracking | In this project, your goal is to write a software pipeline to identify vehicles in a video from a front-facing camera on a car. |
[`project`][type-project] | [Traffic Sign Classifier](https://github.com/romanroibu/carnd-traffic-sign-classifier) | You just finished getting your feet wet with deep learning. Now put your skills to the test by using deep learning to classify different traffic signs! |
[`project`][type-project] | [Behavioral Cloning](https://github.com/romanroibu/carnd-behavioral-cloning) | Put your deep learning skills to the test with this project! Train a deep neural network to drive a car like you! |
[`project`][type-project] | [Extended Kalman Filters](https://github.com/romanroibu/carnd-extended-kalman-filter) | In this project, you'll apply everything you've learned so far about Sensor Fusion by implementing an Extended Kalman Filter in C++! |

## Term 2: Localization, Path Planning, Control, and System Integration

[`project`][type-project] | Kidnapped Vehicle | In this project, you'll build a particle filter and combine it with a real map to localize a vehicle! |
[`project`][type-project] | Path Planning Project | In this project, youâ€™ll design a path planner that is able to create smooth, safe paths for the car to follow along a 3 lane highway with traffic. |
[`project`][type-project] | PID Controller | In this project you'll revisit the lake race track from the Behavioral Cloning Project. This time, however, you'll implement a PID controller in C++ to maneuver the vehicle around the track! |
[`project`][type-project] | Model Predictive Control | In this project, you'll implement Model Predictive Control to drive a vehicle around the track even with additional latency between commands! |
[`project`][type-project] | Programming a Real Self-Driving Car! | In this project you will be run your code on Carla, the Udacity self-driving vehicle! You can provide feedback in the project rubric along with links to datasets or videos that you want to provide to the student. |
